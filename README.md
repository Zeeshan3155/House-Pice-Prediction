Designed and developed an end-to-end real state price prediction website for the Bangaluru area in India. The first step involves data analysis, data cleaning, data visualization, and creating a machine learning model to predict house prices. I have built a model using sklearn and linear regression. The second step is to build a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve HTTP requests and the third step is to build a website in HTML, CSS, and javascript that allows the user to enter the home square ft area, bedrooms, etc and it will call the python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
